## Set3
### Familiarize the concepts of classes, Objects, Methods, Method overloading and constructor overloading

1. Program to create a student class with name, roll no and marks of five subjects. Write functions to 
read and display the details.

2. Write a Java program to calculate the area of different shapes namely circle, rectangle, and triangle 
using the concept of method overloading.
3. Write a Java program to calculate the perimeter of different shapes namely circle and rectangle using 
the concept of constructor overloading.
4. Java program to create a class employee with details such as empno, name and phone number. Read 
details of at least 5employees and print.

## Set 4
### AIM: To implement the concepts of constructors, inheritance, method overloading & overriding, polymorphism

1. Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name,
Age,Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'print-Salary( )' which prints the salary
of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherit the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 
'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, 
age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these
classes and print the same.

2. Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named 
numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of
the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( )
that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures.

3. Write two Java classes Employee and Engineer. Engineer should inherit from the Employee class. 
Employee class to have two methods display() and calcSalary(). Write a program to display the 
engineer salary and to display from Employee class using a single object instantiation (i.e., only one 
object creation is allowed).

a) display() only prints the name of the class and does not return any value. Ex. “ Name of class 
is Employee.”

b) calcSalary() in Employee displays “Salary of employee is 10000” and calcSalary() in 
Engineer displays “Salary of employee is 20000.”

## Set 5
### Aim: To Familiarize with exception handling mechanism in java
1. Write a program that demonstrates exception handling mechanisms.

(a) Arithmetic exception

(b) Array out of index exception

## Set 6
### Aim : To familiarize with multithreading in java
1. Write a Java program to create two threads: One for displaying all odd number between 1 and 100 
and second thread for displaying all even numbers between 1 and 100.

## Set 7
### Aim: To familiarize file operations in Java
1. Write a Java program that reads a file and displays the file on the screen, with a line number before 
each line by handling all file related exceptions.

2. Write a Java program that reads a line of integers from a file, and then displays each integer, and the 
sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of java.util).
